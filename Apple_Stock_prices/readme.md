Implementing the Linear Regression on the Apple Closing Stock Price.
The model takes the input of the 'Apple' company stock prices and outputs the prediction of the Closing price of the stock. 

It is implemented on Python using Linear Regression Models.Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Used the Quandl API to apply ML to the stock market.

After you register, you will be provided with a unique API key, that you should store: Store the API key as a string - according to PEP8, constants are always named in all upper case API_KEY = ''

**Linear Regression Pros**:
- Simple to implement.
- Overfitting can be reduced by regularization
- Used to predict numeric values.
- Performance on linearly seperable datasets

**Linear Regression Cons**:
- Prone to overfitting.
- Sensitive to outliers
- Cannot be used when the relation between independent and dependent variable are non linear.
